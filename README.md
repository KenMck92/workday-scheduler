# workday-scheduler

## Description 

HTML:
In HTML I added divs to show the times of the day for the planner to show a 9am-5pm time frame. I linked the sources for jquery and Dayjs. I added the hrefs for my css and javascript pages. 

Javascript:
In Javascript I used jquery to create variables for IDs and classes to display time for my planner. I used if statements to save information once text is entered in the text box once the save button is clicked. I implemented jquery to store the information entered into my local storage and to stay saved on the page each time the planner is refreshed or later visited.
